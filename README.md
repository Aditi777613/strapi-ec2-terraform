# Strapi Application

This is a basic Strapi application.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-strapi-repo.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd strapi-app

3. Install the dependencies:

   npm install

4. Start the application:

   npm run develop

5. Deployment

This application is set up to be deployed using Terraform and GitHub Actions.

6. API Directory

The `api` directory will contain the API endpoints you create. You can use the Strapi admin panel to generate content types and controllers, which will automatically populate this directory. For example, an API for an article might look like this:

api/
└── article
├── controllers
│ └── article.js
├── models
│ └── article.settings.json
├── services
│ └── article.js
└── routes
└── article.js


These files are automatically generated by Strapi when you create a new content type from the admin panel.
